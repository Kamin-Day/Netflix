## Setup

TODO: Describe how a new developer gets going with this application. Explain that they should consult DBReadMe.txt, and give them any other instructions. How are they supposed to know that they might need to run `bundle install`, for example? Look at the READMEs for gems you have personally used, and model your README after those.
